# Reacti-Vitae - Resume Builder
Reacti-Vitae is a react based Resume builder / Generator. The resume builder is 
currently only limited to one theme. The data is completely sourced from JSON 
data structures. The process of personalizing this resume template is as simple
as traversing through the React components in `src/components/` directory &
modifying the JSON data on each of those components.
