  introduction: `I am a Software Engineer, a Tech Blogger, an Electronics Enthusiast & a Radio Amateur. Over the years I've worked in a few different industries including Real Estate, Insurance, Entertainment & Tech Services. I have built Highly Available Distributed Data Processing Pipelines, International Taxation & Financial Systems and Event Driven Distributed Microservice Platforms. More recently, I've been exploring lambda calculus, combinatory logic, category theory & functional programming. I consider my experience, technical skills and managerial abilities to be the three pillars of my performance as an asset to any organization.`,
